# Project Progress

> **This file is the single source of truth for implementation state.**
> Every AI session working on this project must read this file first and update it before closing the session. It is the handoff document between sessions.

## How to Use This File

**At the start of a session:**

1. Read this file in full.
2. Check **Current Status** — if it reads `NO ACTIVE SPRINT`, do not begin implementation work. Wait for the user to define the next version.
3. If a sprint is active, find the next incomplete task in the Task Registry.
4. Cross-reference the task's epic file (`docs/active/epics/`) for the full work spec.
5. Cross-reference `docs/active/PRD.md` for acceptance criteria and algorithm details.

**During a session:**

- Update the task's status to `[~]` (in progress) when you begin it.
- Append a Session Log entry with what you're doing and any notable decisions.

**At the end of a session:**

- Mark completed tasks `[x]`.
- If a task is blocked, mark it `[!]` and note the blocker.
- Append a Session Log entry summarizing what was completed, decisions made, and where you left off.
- Capture anything non-obvious in Lessons Learned.

**Status legend:**

| Symbol | Meaning                       |
| ------ | ----------------------------- |
| `[ ]`  | Not started                   |
| `[~]`  | In progress                   |
| `[x]`  | Complete                      |
| `[!]`  | Blocked — see log for details |

## Current Status

**Phase:** NO ACTIVE SPRINT — awaiting next development cycle
**Active version:** None
**Next task:** None — Task Registry is empty; populate `docs/active/PRD.md` and `docs/active/epics/` to begin the next cycle
**Blocking issues:** None

---

## Task Registry

<!-- TODO: Populate with epics and tasks when a new development cycle begins. -->
<!-- Format each epic as shown below:

### Epic N: [Epic Title]

> Full spec: `docs/active/epics/epic-N-[slug].md`

| Status | Task    | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| `[ ]`  | **N.1** | ...         |

-->

_(No active tasks. Populate when the next development cycle begins.)_

---

## Session Log

> Entries are prepended (newest first). Each entry records the date, what was attempted, what was completed, and any decisions made that aren't captured elsewhere.

<!-- SESSION ENTRY TEMPLATE — copy and fill in:

### YYYY-MM-DD — [brief title]

**Tasks touched:** X.Y, X.Z
**Outcome:** completed / partial / blocked

**What happened:**
[What was done, in plain language. Include any approaches tried that didn't work.]

**Decisions made:**
[Any implementation choices not fully specified by the PRD, or PRD ambiguities resolved.]

**Left off at:**
[Exact task and step where the session ended, so the next session can resume without re-reading everything.]

_(No sessions logged yet.)_

## Lessons Learned

> Non-obvious things discovered during implementation that future sessions should know. Append entries; do not delete old ones.

_(None yet — populated as implementation proceeds.)_
